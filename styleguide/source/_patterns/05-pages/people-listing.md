### Description
A page with either grid or a list of people bios

#### User Story
As a user, when viewing people listing page, I want to see a page that uses the [One Column Template](/?p=templates-one-column), a [Masthead](/?p=organisms-masthead) in the "Content Top" region and [people listing as card](/?p=molecule-people-as-card) in the main content section
